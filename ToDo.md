# To-Do items

- add a way to move selected files into a shared drive; e.g.
  - "folder" > "Item A"
  - "folder" > "subfolder" > "Item B"
  - rather than:
  - "folder" (which would include ___all___ items therein)
  - It would work like this:
    ```shell
    app.py -d destination -i input-file
    ```
